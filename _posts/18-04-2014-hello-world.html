    Hi everyone,
</p>
<p>
    I used to (and I'm still doing) note down interesting, and handy facts while I learn things. When I had a look at those documents yesterday, I thought it would be better to brush them up, and put them in a blog, so that people can make use of them. There are many articles available about most of the things I write, but I have made my effort to explain things more simple, and clear with real life examples.

     My interest in computers started while I was in 9th grade, the Indian equivalent of the junior high. I was thens pulled towards the free software foundation and its philosophy, which changed my concepts about computers and softwares. Those were the days of 57kbps modems and 2.x linux kernels and it was really hard to get an issue fixed. Things have changed now and getting an answer is not a big deal, if you can ask the  right question.

    I will be very happy if my works can make lives better. Your feedback is my only encouragement. Keep supporting.  \m/
