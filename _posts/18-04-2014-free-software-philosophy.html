    Its a general practice in our society to ignore to the most basic and important things, and worry more about less important, unnecessary things. For exmple, when we hear about a software, what we ask first is, <i>is it easy to use?</i> or <i>is it popular?</i> rather than <i>does it respect my freedom?</i> or <i>How does it work?</i>. A software, when sold to you as a product, is not fully in your ownership. When you buy a car, the car belongs to you in all the sense. You can let anyone, obviously with a driving license, to drive it. You can modify it as you see fit, you can sell it to anyone you want, and that buyer also have all those same privileges as yours.

    Well, this is not the case of a software product. No copyrighted, propreitary software lets you know how it works, that means you can't see the sourcecode. Also it restricts your freedom to share it with your friends. How bad is that? You give your money, you buy the software. Still you <b>don't have the right</b> to know what it does in your computer, or you can't share it with your friends.

    On the other hand, a free software(free as in freedom, not free beer) uses a <b>copyleft</b> and respects your freedom. The free software movement is based on the idea that a software is not a product, it is a piece of knowledge, and knowledge should be shared. If the user/users of a software gets the below four freedoms, it can be called a free software.

    <ul>
        <li>The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).</li>
        <li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it
              does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source
              code is a precondition for this.
        </li>
        <li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor
              (freedom 2).
        </li>
        <li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions
              to others (freedom 3).  By doing this you can give the whole
              community a chance to benefit from your changes.
              Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
        </li>
    </ul>

    Humans have built marvellous structures, explored the world, fought with everything that stood against them, and became the most advanced species in the universe, as far as we know now, all because of sharing their knowledge with each other. This philosophy of sharing what you know is the keystone of any development. Together, a better world can be created.
